# Santos L Reatil Warehouse

First 'real world' project.

Almacenes Santos L (Santos L Retail Warehouse) is a local company
that sells a variety of products.

The idea is to start as a catalog-type website so the company can
boost its online presence as well as display its products to grow 
its customer base, and make known its services.

One big goal is, to allow customers to request quotes with the 
exact products they want information/pricing about and empower 
the warehouse to supply a quote for the service streamlining its 
production.

Currently, I'm gathering information and drafting some ideas to 
start wireframing.
